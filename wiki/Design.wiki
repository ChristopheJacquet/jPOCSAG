= Introduction to receiving POCSAG =

POCSAG is a paging protocol originally developed by the British Post Office.

The binary data, in the form of a rectangular signal, is directly used to modulate the carrier wave in FSK, with a shift of Â± 4.5 kHz. 

Unfortunately a narrowband FM (NFM) receiver such as an amateur radio rig will filter the signals narrower than 4.5 kHz, so you don't get a nice rectangular signal out of the earphone plug. One solution is to use (or add) a discriminator output, but it often proves impractical.

Considering the derivative of the signals and using a software [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger Schmitt trigger] with adaptive threshold, jPOCSAG achieves to reconstruct the original signals in the vast majority of the cases.
